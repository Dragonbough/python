# python projects

This repository holds all the python files that I have created, whether for fun or personal application. You will watch this repository grow with the expansion of my Python skill, as I also take on more projects.

### Roadmap

This is my Trello list for the Python programming language. Although the list is long, and I have not progressed very far (at the time of writing this), I believe I am well equipped with the language. I understand the basics, so the next item on my agenda is learning the theory of object-oriented programming (OOP). When I progress through every item in this list, I can truly say that I have mastered Python. Just you wait and see.
